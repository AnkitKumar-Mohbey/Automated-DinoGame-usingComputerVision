## Overview

Dinamo is a simple game where players control a character to avoid obstacles. The game utilizes computer vision techniques at the backend to automatically analyze the gameplay environment in real-time and respond to obstacles. It employs straightforward image processing methods to achieve obstacle detection, ensuring real-time performance without dropping below 30 frames per second (FPS).

We welcome contributions from other developers to enhance and improve the game further.

## Features

- Utilizes computer vision for real-time obstacle detection and gameplay analysis.
- Implements simple yet effective image processing techniques for obstacle detection.
- Maintains real-time performance with FPS consistently above 30.
